# BeFrank (BFR) Solan SPR Token – Whitepaper

---

## 1. Introduction

BeFrank (BFR) is a socially-oriented cryptocurrency built on the Solana blockchain. It was created with the mission of embedding fairness, transparency, and social responsibility directly into the financial fabric of every transaction. With BeFrank, every transfer of tokens includes an automatic contribution to a Welfare Fund designed to support community projects, without penalizing the recipient.

**Vision**: To create a decentralized economic system where social impact is integral and transparent.

**Mission**: Empower communities and support public good initiatives through automated, trustless contributions at the transaction layer.

---

## 2. Technological Foundation

BeFrank is implemented as an SPL token on the Solana blockchain, leveraging:

- **SPL token standard**: Enables high-performance, low-cost transactions.
- **Anchor framework**: For secure and auditable smart contracts.
- **Token22 extensions**: (Planned) to allow future expandability (e.g. transfer hooks, metadata).

Key advantages of Solana include:
- Transaction speeds of up to 65,000 TPS
- Average fees below $0.001
- Sustainable energy use

---

## 3. Transaction Logic

BeFrank introduces a unique transaction fee model:
- The **recipient always receives 100%** of the intended amount.
- The **sender pays an additional 1% fee** on top of the transferred amount.

This fee is automatically split as follows:
- **0.5%** → Welfare Fund (social impact treasury)
- **0.25%** → Staking pool (rewards for long-term holders)
- **0.25%** → Ecosystem fund (platform growth and partnerships)

---

## 4. Welfare Fund

The Welfare Fund is a smart-contract-managed treasury that receives:
- 10% of the initial token supply
- 0.5% of every future transaction

Funds are managed by a DAO and can only be distributed to projects that pass a community vote.

- **Transparent**: All inflows and outflows are on-chain.
- **Democratic**: Token holders vote on proposals.
- **Sustainable**: Grows naturally through economic activity.
